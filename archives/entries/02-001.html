<b>Above</b>
   <br><br>
I often think of that place. <br>
   A place where the coral grows not, <br>
   A place I long to be. <br>
   With a priest gone mad, <br>
   And among all these stupid fads, <br>
   <br>
   I look out the water, <br>
   And see a <i>boy.</i> <br>
   I like this boy. <br>
   Though it feels I am not supposed to. <br>
   <br>
   Such are the urges of my mind, <br>
   I can't stop thinking, <br>
   I put my eyes and he meets mine, <br>
   A sin<br> greater <br>than most.
