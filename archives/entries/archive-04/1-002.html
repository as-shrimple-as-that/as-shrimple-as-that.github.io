  <b> Entry #2</b>
   <br><br>
After the Pope left to attend to a "mission" (exactly what he called it), I snuck into his study, located inside the chapel. To my surprise, what I saw was similar to what I jokingly predicted in the previous entry.<br><br> His desk and walls were covered in theories and passages from books and records. Charts and drawings, strange patterns, I truly don't know what any of this is, how it's linked, where to look, where any of this even STARTS. Simply put, I'm at a loss.<br><br> But I think that now's not the time for theories. His writing-- it was illegible. That's nothing like the neat handwriting he used to have. It was so clear, a newborn could read it. He must be losing his mind in all the inane obsessions. An insane preist may spell trouble for all. Unfortunately, I'm powerless to everything. While I <i>am</i> the Princess of Shrimp, I have no power. That is all possesed by Mother, of whom is currently out of the city.  <br> Oh, when will she return? We <i>need</i> her. <br><br>On another, less pressure-inducing note, Kylie 'met a guy.' <br>"Get the press here, now! Kylie met a guy," I called, as a joke. She didn't seem to take this very kindly. She explained how he's 'cute' and whatnot, and said she's been keeping it secret, so clearly she has a crush on this guy, but, I'm not quite sure why she's kept this person's entirety a <i>secret</i> from all. They aren't dating, yet, clearly, with how much she spoke of wanting to feel his supple hands. <br><br> That's all for now, I'll throw in a new entry when I need to write of anything else.
