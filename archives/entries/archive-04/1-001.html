Some strange things have been happening lately, and since Mother has been gone, I have not many people to talk to, and I dare not tell these happenings to our poor maids and butlers. <br><br> I am Callia, daughter of the Empress of Shrimp. I am part of the Royal Family of Shrimp. My father is deceased, and I have a brother named Dylan. <br><br> I fear that things may be going to take a turn for the worst. Our Pope has recently become obsessed with something. We can't figure out what, but I plan to sneak into his study to see if he's made any notes or anything about what it is. I half expect to see a corkboard with red string and a ton of scrawled-on notes pinned to it, with how much he's been obsessing with it. <br><br> He's been skipping ceremonies sometimes, which is extremely unlike him, as he's the holiest person I know. <br><br> That will be all for now, I'll write back here next time I feel need.
