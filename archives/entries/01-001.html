Today I attend the Council of Shrimps meeting. I know not of what to expect from it, but I do hope my unbirthed child will not cause any issues while I am there. Or, that is, my nasty coworkers poking and prodding around me, as if I'm glass in a museum. <br><br>I can hear their irritating voices now.<br><br>
   "You're pregnant? Oh my Goddess! I had no idea! Let me put my hands on you! Childbirth is <i>truly</i> magical!"
   <br><br>
   I really wish they will not do such things.
