The meeting was strange, however. Nothing unusual happened, however something felt very <i>off.</i> I felt off, and the others were indeed less energetic than usual, despite their glee and swooning for my child.

   Though, they did <i>attempt</i> to touch me. Disgusting, how they think they can just touch a <u>princess</u> like that.
