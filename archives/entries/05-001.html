Some people say that I'm just an old woman, slowly losing my grip. That may be true, but I still have a conscienceness. Nothing excuses them from being rude to me. It's not like it's a huge issue for me, because I still have a mind and thoughts to think. And this city, ooh, so pretty. <br><br>

The way the light reflects through the surface above and gently caresses the sand and seagrass, the gentle waves of currents in the morning and the soft and deep voice of the whales to wake us. <br><br>

Our Coral City is truly beautiful. Truly an excellent city. So many different Shrimp, and the walls we've built around the village to prevent attacks, we're truly safe here. This is the city of freedom. <br><br>

The nights are cold yet comforting. The light from the stars twinkle in the smooth trickling of the waves of water, and it's the perfect time to take a swim around town. <br><br>

Though my mind is old, I still see and feel the everyday beauty. This city is so full of life. Children swimming around, playing and chasing one-another, it's truly a lively sight. <br><br>

It's a great city, and I'm glad that this is where I may die.
