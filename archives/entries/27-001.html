         Entry Description: Strange & cryptic writings predicting an assumed "great calamity." <br>This is three pages of what looks to be part of hundreds of pages. <br> The last (third) page seems to be repeating the writing "A mind gone mad is a mind gone bad." <br> Subject shows clear signs of insanity, possibly caused by the epiphany that they are depicting here. <br> They acknowledge this insanity. <br>No more is known of this entry.
