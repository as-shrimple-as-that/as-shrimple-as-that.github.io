      You have stumbled yourself upon the Crustacean Clan's Archives. You may be asking, what exactly is this? What is the Crustacean Clan?<br> Well, I, Welfoe, am here to answer that. There is a series of journals, recovered by lost travellers and brought back. <br><br> The Crustacean Clan still exists to this day, however, they are mostly blind to the history of it. <br><br> YOU are mostly blind to it.<br><br> This is the Crustacean Clan Archives.
