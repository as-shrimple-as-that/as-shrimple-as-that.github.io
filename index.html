      You have stumbled yourself upon the Crustacean Clan's Webpage. You may be asking, what exactly is this? What is the Crustacean Clan?<br> Well, we are here to answer that.

         The first thing you may be pondering is <b>"Where did this come from?"</b> Well, for centuries, the Boxing League community have cried the phrase "it's as shrimple as that," desperate for the coming of Shrimple. <br><br> But, the CCC isn't limited to this silly little video game, no, we spread beyond it. <br><br> This site exists to enlighten the unenlightened. Inform the uninformed, of what The Crustacean Clan is. <br> It goes into not only the history of it, but also the lore we have yet to uncover. <br><br>
